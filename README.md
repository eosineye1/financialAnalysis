# Financial Analysis: Electronic Arts Inc. & Activision Blizzard Inc.

I collected the financial statements of both Electronic Arts and Activision Blizzard. These financial statements included their balance sheet, income sheet, and cash flow for the year 2019 - 2015. I used this information to calculate several ratios for both companies including but not limited to their profitability, liquidity, and profitability ratios. After calculating these ratios, I used my statistical and corporate finance knowledge to write a financial analysis report of both companies comparing and contrasting their financial health and using this information to predict which company is a better investment for future investors.
